- ## I am [Chandan Kumar Pradhan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chandan-kumar-pradhan-0788361a0). A RPA Enthusiast.  I earned today real out-of-the-box knowledge on `Language Detection` and `English Text Classification` like ML Skill sets on _**UIPath Studio**_. How to train a ML model and stuffs learned in another IDTC RPA tech camp associated with **UIPath** & **WonderBotz** organized by **IncubateIND**.

- ## Really I learned about **Robotic Process Automation with AI Center** from my mentor [Nisarg Kadam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nisargkadam/) and  [Parth Doshi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/parth-doshi-learning-by-doing/). Thanks for conducting this kind of tech camps [Anuj Sharma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anujsharma378/), [Kaushik Roy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kroy96/).
- ## I did today's tasküìù successfully but yes it's tricky and somewhat easyüòÄ.
